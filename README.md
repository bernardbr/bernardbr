ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I am a software developer passionate about what I do. Additionally, I love sharing the knowledge I have gained over the years, I'm an avid gamer, and last but not least, I am passionate about my family. Let me tell you a little more about myself:

ðŸ”­ Currently, I am excited to be part of the [@Paybyrd](https://github.com/paybyrd) team, where I contribute to developing innovative payment solutions.

ðŸŒ± As a father, son, and husband, my family is central to my life. They are my daily motivation and my haven. Sharing moments with them is a true treasure.

ðŸ‘¯ In my technology career, I have accumulated over 17 years of experience in software development. Over these years, I have developed an unwavering passion for my work. Every day, I dive into new challenges, constantly seeking to expand my knowledge and skills.

ðŸ’¡ Continuous learning is an essential part of my professional journey. I love exploring new technologies, keeping up with the latest trends, and learning from the developer community. But true satisfaction comes from sharing what I have learned. I firmly believe that sharing knowledge is a way to elevate the whole community and build a stronger ecosystem.

âš¡ Besides software development, I am a gaming enthusiast. From board games to video games, I enjoy having fun and challenging myself in different virtual worlds. Games teach me skills such as problem-solving, teamwork, and perseverance, and they help me relax and recharge.

ðŸŒŸ As a software developer, father, nerd, and human being, I am constantly striving to do the best I can, both professionally and personally. I am excited to connect with inspiring people, collaborate on challenging projects, and continue growing in all aspects of my life.

If you have any questions or want to know more, just ask! I'm here to help.
